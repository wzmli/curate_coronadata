# Curating COVID-19 Data

This is the data curating repository for COVID-19 open source data from various sources.
This repository does not have any data, but has code to pull in data from different sources and attempts to _clean_ (using tidyverse tools) and _curate_ by applying a filter to the data that fixes data problems.
