# Issues

## Data filling required

- Data after March 5th are not filled in... volunteers?

## Definition Change off sync

- There was a defintion change on Feb 13 cause the Hubei data to spike on that day. Globally and China confirmed cases did not update the change on the same day, resulting the increase spike on Feb 16. We can easily see that between Feb 14-16, the number of confirm cases in Hubei are larger than China/Globally confirm cases.
